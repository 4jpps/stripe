# Stripe Net Payout Calculator

A modern, high-precision tool to calculate the exact amount to charge a customer to ensure you receive a specific net payout after Stripe's processing fees (2.9% + $0.30).

This tool is designed for freelancers, MSPs, and small businesses who need to pass on credit card fees transparently and accurately.

## ✨ Features

- **Glassmorphism UI**: A sleek, modern "frosted glass" interface that looks great on any background.
- **System Theme Support**: Automatically switches between Light and Dark modes based on user OS settings.
- **Precision Logic**: Uses reverse-math formulas to account for fees being taken from the *total* charge, not the net.
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Shows a 4-step logic path including:
  - Base subtotal calculation.
  - Percentage fee scaling.
  - **Rounding Variance**: Tracks the fractional-cent difference between math and banking reality.
- **One-Click Copy**: Quickly copy the Surcharge amount to your clipboard for invoicing.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS. No frameworks, no tracking, no bloat.

## 🧮 The Math

Most people mistakenly add 2.9% to their target price, but because Stripe takes 2.9% of the *final* total, you end up short. This tool uses the correct formula:

$$Total = \frac{Net + 0.30}{1 - 0.029}$$



## 💻 Usage

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Enter your target payout and view the results instantly.
